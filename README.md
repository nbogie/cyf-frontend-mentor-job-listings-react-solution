rough React sample solution to the great frontend-mentor "job listings" challenge
https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/job-listings-with-filtering-ivstIPCt

This solution is in two parts, one per branch:

- `master`: no filtering
- `full`: full solution including filtering (but no responsive design)

This is aimed at students in first week of the React module at [CYF](https://codeyourfuture.io/).
